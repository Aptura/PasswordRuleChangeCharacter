# Rule-based passphrase character changer
NodeJS script to change the characters of a rule-based passphrase.

All you have to do is change the values of each "if". You can add or remove if rules. 

This allows you to change characters in a passphrase according to defined rules. Don't forget to remember the rules you set up, so you can easily remember your password.
